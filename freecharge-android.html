						<p>Freecharge, founded in 2010, was the first digital payments platform in India. With the introduction of an online wallet in 2015, 
						users could now pay across all major online platforms as well as
						offline stores like McDonalds,  Zomato, HP Petrol etc.</p>
						<p>Post my joining Freecharge in 2015, I was given the responsibility of revamping the user experience on the web platform. This included incorporating an improved UI as well as introduction of many  new features. With a lot of idea formulation & an equal number being scrapped, this is an ongoing journey for me (hopefully with a good ending!)</p>
